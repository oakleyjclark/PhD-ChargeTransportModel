# PhD-ChargeTransportModel
This code simulates the charge transport of electrons and holes in the HEXITEC detector

The input to this system is a list of energy depositions as a csv file, that was attained by a Geant4 simulation. An example input file is uploaded, with 10000 simulated events to a monochromatic 59.5keV gamma beam.

To run the code, run Main.py
