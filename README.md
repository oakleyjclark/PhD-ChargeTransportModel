# PhD-ChargeTransportModel
This code simulates the charge transport of electrons and holes in the HEXITEC detector

The input to this system is a list of energy depositions as a csv file, that was attained by a Geant4 simulation. An example input file is uploaded, with 5000 simulated events. 

To run the code, run Main.py
